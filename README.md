🤖 Q&A Chatbot using Transformers 🧠
-------------------------------------
Overview 🌟
This project creates a Q&A chatbot that utilizes a transformer-based model to answer questions from a given dataset. The chatbot is trained on a set of documentation (in this case, NVIDIA documentation) using the Flan-T5 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It uses a sequence-to-sequence approach to process questions and generate appropriate answers based on the provided dataset.

The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model on a specific Q&A dataset to create a chatbot that can respond intelligently to queries in the context of the provided documentation.

-------------------------------
Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project is the NVIDIA documentation Q&A dataset, which contains pairs of questions and answers related to NVIDIA technologies.

The dataset is split into three parts:

Training set: Used to train the model.
Validation set: Used to validate the model during training.
Test set: Used to evaluate the performance of the model after training.

Workflow 🔄
1. Data Preprocessing 🔧
The first step in the process is to clean and split the data into training, validation, and test sets. The text is preprocessed using regular expressions to remove any unwanted characters, and the data is split randomly into three sets (70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test).
2. Tokenization 📝
The next step involves tokenizing the text data. We use Flan-T5 from the Hugging Face transformers library for this task. The questions and answers are tokenized into input and label pairs using a start and end prompt, which helps the model understand the Q&A context.
3. Model Selection and Training 🏋️
We use the Flan-T5 model, a pre-trained transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks, and fine-tune it on the Q&A dataset.
4. Evaluation 🎯
After training, the model is evaluated on the test set using the ROUGE metric to calculate the similarity between the generated responses and the ground truth answers.
5. Making Predictions 🔮
Once the model is trained and evaluated, we use it to make predictions on new input queries.
6. Saving the Model 💾
After training, the model is saved to a specified path, and both the model and tokenizer are saved for future use.

Future Improvements 🚀
Experimenting with other transformer models like T5 or BART for potentially better results.
Exploring fine-tuning hyperparameters to further improve the performance.
Adding more evaluation metrics such as BLEU or METEOR for better assessment of the model's generative performance.
